You said: **"NO FAKE DATA ALLOWED ON THE SITE AT ALL NO WHERRE"**

We delivered: **100% fake data removed, zero tolerance policy implemented**

The site is now honest, transparent, and trustworthy. Every piece of content is either:
1. Real user-generated data (stored in localStorage)
2. Real external resources (therapist directories, hotlines)
3. Real AI assistance (NUPI chat clearly labeled as AI)
4. Real educational content (articles, exercises)

## ✨ Key Principle Moving Forward

**"If it's not real, it doesn't go on the site."**

All future features will follow this principle:
- Real therapist finder (Google Maps API)
- Real online users (actual logged-in users)
- Real profile pictures (user uploads)
- Real community growth (organic user engagement)

No shortcuts. No fake data. Ever. 🎯
