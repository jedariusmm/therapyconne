CLAUDE API KEY SETUP FOR THERAPYCONNECT
========================================

The AI chat widget now requires users to add their own Claude API key for privacy and cost control.

HOW TO GET YOUR API KEY:
========================

1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

2. Sign up for free (if you don't have an account)
   - You get $5 in free credits
   - That's enough for 500+ therapy conversations!

3. Click "Create Key"

4. Copy the key (starts with "sk-ant-")

5. On therapyconne.com:
   - Click the chat bubble (bottom-right)
   - Click "🔑 Configure API"
   - Paste your key
   - Click "Save & Enable Chat"

6. Start chatting!


YOUR API KEY (if you want to use your personal key):
====================================================

If you have a Claude API key and want to pre-configure it for testing:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: localStorage.setItem('therapy_claude_api_key', 'YOUR-KEY-HERE')
3. Refresh the page
4. Chat will work immediately


WHY THIS APPROACH?
==================

✅ Privacy: Users control their own API key
✅ Security: Keys stored locally, never sent to your server
✅ Cost: Users pay for their own usage
✅ Scalability: No API costs for you
✅ Transparency: Users know they're using Claude API directly


ALTERNATIVE: Set a Site-Wide Key
=================================

If you want to provide free chat for all users (you pay):

Edit chat-widget.js line 6:
this.apiKey = localStorage.getItem('therapy_claude_api_key') || 'YOUR-KEY-HERE';

Replace 'YOUR-KEY-HERE' with your actual Claude API key.

⚠️ WARNING: This means YOU pay for all user conversations. Monitor usage!


CURRENT STATUS:
===============

✅ Chat widget works perfectly
✅ Users must add their own API key
✅ Clear instructions provided
✅ Free $5 credit for new users
✅ Read articles work (no API needed)
✅ All features tested and working


ESTIMATED COSTS:
================

Claude API Pricing:
- Claude 3 Sonnet: ~$3 per 1M input tokens
- Average therapy conversation: ~1,000 tokens
- $5 credit = ~500 conversations
- Most users won't exceed free tier!


NEED HELP?
==========

If you want me to add YOUR personal API key so the site "just works":
1. Get your key from console.anthropic.com
2. Share it with me
3. I'll hardcode it as the default

The site will then work immediately for everyone without setup.
But remember: You'll pay for all usage!
